# Hand-Tracking

This project uses Google's MediaPipe ML Solutions to track the position of hands using OpenCV in Python

The **HandTrackingModule.py** file tracks the 21 landmarks on the palm and plots the points in RealTime.
The **FingerTracking.py** file uses the above file and derives the classes and methods from it to detect and find the position of the landmarks.
